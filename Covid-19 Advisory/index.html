                <h1>What is COVID-19?</h1>
                <h2>------------------------</h2>
                <p>Covid had arrived in every country in the world. This pandemic not only has corrupted the usual routines that human beings used to do, but 
                also made us evolve. What we mean with evolve, is that the education system turned so flexible that was able to keep up classes via online in a 
                maximum of two months after the pandemic started. Scientific development in the world also had their progress, so they discovered a 
                vaccine for the Covid in less than a year, when usually discovering one takes over five years or more.</br>
                
                <br>“There are three COVID-19 vaccines for which certain national regulatory authorities have authorized the use. None have yet received 
                WHO EUL/PQ authorization but we expect an assessment on the Pfizer vaccine by the end of December and for some other candidates soon 
                thereafter.” (World Health Organization, 2020).</br></p>

                <h2>Why getting the Covid vaccine?</h2>
                <p><br>We all know there are some people concerned about getting vaccinated now that COVID-19 vaccines are available in some countries. 
                    While more COVID-19 vaccines are being developed as quickly as possible, routine processes and procedures remain in place to ensure of 
                    any vaccine that is authorized or approved for use. Safety is a top priority, and there are many reasons to get vaccinated.</br></p>

                <h3>The COVID-19 vaccine will help you avoid getting it</h3>
                <p><br>COVID-19 vaccines that are in development are being carefully evaluated in clinical trials and will be authorized 
                or approved only if they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19.</br></p>
                
                <h3>COVID-19 vaccination will be an important and essential tool to help stop the pandemic</h3>
                <p><br>Wearing masks and social distancing help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, 
                but these measures are not enough. Vaccines will work with your immune system so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed.</br></p>
                
                <h2>Are these vaccines safe?</h2>
                <p><br> Though most of these vaccines have not been approved and their percentage of success is 95%, there is a vaccine which the level of 
                danger is almost nonexistent, the mRNA vaccine. This vaccine works in a completely different way than the other ones. Mainly because you 
                are not getting any virus applied into your body, but instead, just a protein. This protein is not recognized by your body, making it generate
                antibodies. So as you are not getting any virus, you cannot get covid by any chance. But you are generating the defenses to attack it in case of 
                getting infected.</br></p>
