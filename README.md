# CHEZYCODE 2021 PROYECT BY BULUK # 3472: Covid-19 Advisory.

The main purpose of this project was to develop a page where people could inform themselves and avoid the ingestion of harmful medicines and chemicals. To show them why it is wrong, we ask them some questions for then choosing the correct link that will guide them to an official and trustworthy page that will convince them on why is wrong.

This web page is divided into 3 tabs, first, we have "Covid Prevention and Survey" where the reader can submit a small survey, but, what we ask for ?, we ask for name, age, if he or she has been in recent physical contact with someone infected, state of residence (we centred in México our website) and in addition to that we provide an infographic in which the reader can see if he has suffered any of the symptoms of this disease. We ask the state of residence thinking that if we could get a lot of submissions we can advise people if their zones are high or low contagion.

The second tab is "Medicine" in here you can be redirected to different websites to know why self medicate is not the option to this disease, to educate and let the reader know what to do in case of suffer Covid-19.

Finally, you can look at the "More About Covid-19" tab, in here we add some information to you to know about this pandemic disease that has changed the way many of us live.

Why do we choose a website?
Nowadays we know that the internet has become an essential tool, this means that the most of the people have access to a website through the internet, this can help the community and vulnerable populations to identify symptoms and even know the degree of contagion in the area where they live, making people aware of keeping in use the necessary sanitation measures to maintain a healthy life.
